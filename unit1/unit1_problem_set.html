        <h1>About Me - Gavin Grooms</h1>
        <p>
            Hello, my name is Gavin and I am excited to take this web programming course. I first built a website on my own in Angular in 2021 before I decided to start the MS in Computer Science degree program at Tufts for a more formal education. I'm looking forward to filling in any gaps in my web programming knowledge!<br><br>

            I'll be participating online from Utah, and I currently work remotely as a backend QA Engineer for a SaaS company based out of Ohio. I work with web applications and write automated tests that interact directly with the code base to ensure that new features and functions work correctly even after they're released. I'm looking forward to eventually transitioning into a Software Engineering role in the near future!<br><br>

            Outside of class and work, I love to go out on date nights with my wife and play Nintendo Switch. I'm looking forward to a great semester!<br>
        </p>
        <ul aria-label="My favorite foods">
            <li>Burgers and Fries</li>
            <li>Chocolate Chip Cookies</li>
            <li>Steak and Corn on the Cob</li>
        </ul>
        <p>My favorite restaurant is <a href="https://www.chick-fil-a.com">Chick-fil-A</a> because they have the best combo of fries, milkshake, and chicken sandwich that I've ever found. It's nice that since they are a chain, I can always find one wherever I go.</p>
